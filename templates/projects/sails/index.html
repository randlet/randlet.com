        <h4>Tech Used</h4>


        <p>
            A selection of the tech that SaILS is built with:

            <ul class="disc-list">
                <li>Python &amp; Django</li>
                <li>jQuery</li>
                <li>Bootstrap 3</li>
            </ul>

            SaILS can be deployed on Linux, Windows or Mac servers.

        <h4>About</h4>

        <p>
            SaILS is an incident learning system custom built for the needs of the
            radiation medicine program at The Ottawa Hospital Cancer Centre.  It
            allows staff anywhere within the clinic to submit an incident report
            from any device with access to the hospital network (Fig 1).
        </p>
        <p>
            SaILS also facilitates the triaging and investigation of incidents
            by allowing incidents to be assigned to specific investigators.
            The results of the investigation are recorded in SaILS (Fig 2.) and can be
            reviewed at any time in the future (Fig 3.).  Follow-up actions (e.g. implement
            a new interlock) can be assigned and tracked until they are completed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Aggregates statistics (Fig 4.) about all the incidents occuring in a given
            calendar year are made available to all staff within the clinic.
            This makes it very easy to spot trends in the types of incidents
            which are ocurring in the clinic allowing staff to decide where
            to focus their efforts in improving clinical practices.
        </p>

        <p>
            All incident data from SaILS can easily be exported to Excel or CSV
            format for easier data mining.
        </p>
