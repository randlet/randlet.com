Just putting this here in case anyone else runs into the same problem.

I recently picked up an <a

but the drivers included with it were giving me a 
`Windows cannot initialize the device driver for this hardware.  (Code 37)` 
displayed in the device manager.  I tried downloading a couple of different drivers for the N13 from the Asus website but kept running into the same issue.

I then noticed that the 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002UVNW5W/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002UVNW5W&linkCode=as2&tag=canaamp05-20">ASUS N13 B1</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=canaamp05-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B002UVNW5W" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
had Windows 8 specific drivers.  Even though I don't think that's the device I
bought, I downloaded the [Windows 8 drivers for it from the Asus site](http://www.asus.com/Networking/USBN13_B1/#support_Download) 
and lo and behold I now have a functioning WIFI USB stick on my home theater PC!
